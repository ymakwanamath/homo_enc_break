# homo_enc_break
This repo contains source code for break of an homomorphic encryption algorithm.

Encryption_2016_paper.py is a program to perform encryption and decryption as defined in the paper published in 2016.  
Break_Enc_2016_paper.py is the implementation of algorihtm described in new manuscript that breaks the original cipher. 
Time_comparison_break_vs_enc.py is a program to compare time taken in encryption and break of the original cipher. 
Results_time_comparison.txt is the text file for output from Time_comparison_break_vs_enc.py.
